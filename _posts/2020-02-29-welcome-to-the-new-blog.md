Hi! This is something of an experiment, I haven't blogged in markdown before, but there's a first time for everything
I guess. 

This is my new personal blog. And probably development blog, as I intend to talk about some of my new projects
as I work on them. I have been wanting to write more and this blog is intended to be a home for that. It might be
projects I am working on, it might be personal stories, and it might be creative writing. Whatever I'm feeling at the 
time.

##### Who am I?
Hi, my name is William Moore. I'm a writer and a Site Reliability Engineer, which is a made up title that means I work
magic with cloud infrastructure (and other stuff, but that's the main thing). 

I love creating things, across all sorts of mediums. I write, fanfic, short stories, bigger novels that aren't done yet,
etc. I like game design and have created a few small games, mostly while I was at university and had more time. 
I draw, and have created a few comics. Lots of things take my interest but it's fair to say I can be a bit scattered.

This blog is in parts a way to focus all that. I have long enjoyed writing, but I have never really had a home for it,
so most of my writing just disappeared into folders on my computer. Or into my diary. I don't know for sure what I will
end up writing about, but I wanted a place for it all to live.
